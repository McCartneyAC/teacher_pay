### exploring by state teacher pay data 2018

Using data from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/03/16/592221378/the-fight-over-teacher-salaries-a-look-at-the-numbers), I have turned their graph into a dataframe for each state with average teacher pay and average teacher pay adjusted for cost of living. I have hard coded states that have had teacher strikes in 2018 via [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/25/602859780/teacher-walkouts-a-state-by-state-guide) as well, in order to visualize their distribution. 

Additional variables likely to be added later as the project grows. 

See [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2018/04/13/which-states-might-experience-the-next-wave-of-teacher-strikes/) for a more rigorous examination of the data.
